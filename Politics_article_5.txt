IPOH: Aid programmes for the people are carried out continuously and not only during festive seasons, including in the Tambun parliamentary constituency, says Muhammad Kamil Abdul Munim.

The political secretary to the Finance Minister said the Village Development and Security Committee (JPKK) and the Tambun Parliamentary Community Service Centre are requested to provide assistance to the people throughout the year.

According to him, despite his busy schedule as Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has always had the interests of the residents close to his heart as Tambun MP.

"We have another 3,000 food packets to be distributed to the needy and we will donate from time to time and not just during Ramadan or Syawal.

"This is what the Prime Minister emphasised when he asked for weekly on-the-ground reports, especially from the Tambun parliamentary constituency so that families in need continue to get helped," he told reporters.

He said this after attending a ceremony to break fast with An-Nur Maisarah Orphanage and handed over food boxes to the JPKK of the Tambun constituency near here on Tuesday (April 2) night.

Muhammad Kamil said the Tambun Parliamentary Community Service Centre will continue to go to the ground to listen to the people's complaints and accommodate them.

He said that the unity government is giving its best and that it will ensure that the problems faced by the people are immediately overcome.

"We also ask the community or residents who have any problems to come to the Tambun parliamentary office or make a complaint online at the parliamentambun.my portal.

"I am confident that the staff of the service centre will always be ready to solve the problems that arise appropriately for the sake of the people of Tambun," he said. - Bernama
