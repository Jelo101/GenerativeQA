ACTRESS Bella Astillah said she holds no grudge against her Singaporean celebrity husband Aliff Aziz and will now focus on her children, reported Berita Harian.

Refusing to make her situation with her husband worse and to avoid being labelled ‘’gila glamour’’ (attention seeking), the 29-year-old said her focus now was to move on.

“Honestly, I am tired of talking about my marriage. There are some people accusing me of being ‘gila glamour,’ that I keep issuing statements.

“Remaining silent is best for now. I want to focus on my life with my children and family.

“I don’t need to look back. Whatever happened has already happened,” she said.

Bella filed for divorce on March 13 at the Syariah Lower Court in Kuala Lumpur.

Bella and Aliff, who have two children, first divorced in 2019 after he was accused of cheating on her but reconciled in 2020.

On her two children, Bella said they were busy with school.

“So far, the two of them have not asked what happened. They are still young and do not understand the situation, so they continue with their own routines,” she added.
